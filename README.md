# connect-four

This is an implementation of Connect-Four in Rust using macroquad. If you don't want to run it locally, you can run it on the [web](https://bi3mer.github.io/connect-four/), but you won't have access to the "impossible" opponent.

## Useful Commands

- Run: `cargo run`
- Test: `cargo test`
- Build wasm release: `cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- Regular release: `cargo build --release`
